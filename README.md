# NBA Prediction
In this project we created a Random Forrest model, that was made into a function that we import into another python file, to accurately predict the winning team and the spread of two NBA teams. We had accumulated 15 years worth of game and team data that we used to train and test the model. We have also tested out the prediction model within a function by choosing a couple of teams that have actually played each other in the past couple of days and we were able to get over 60% accuracy. Finally we have deployed this as a web application through Heroku and a link to this web application will be located below.
